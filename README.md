**Project name:** Stacks-Wiki-Group-3

**Topic:** What Stack Should I choose, And Why

**Description:** A Group GitHub repository for the assignment

* A multi-page wiki (one page per group member)

* Must include a Table Of Contents with links to each team member's page

* Must have a home page that states topic of the wiki, as well as a brief summary of the contents and a link to the TOC.

* Final Deliverable is the URL of the home page. ALL GROUP MEMBERS MUST TURN IN THE LINK SEPARATELY!


**Group Roles:**

Your group may or may not want to consider assigning/volunteering for one or more of the following roles for this wiki project:

* Team Lead

* Editor

* Researcher

* Repo/Wiki Owner

The above list is in no way comprehensive, nor does it represent concrete roles that MUST be assigned.

Performing a specific role DOES NOT mean that you do not have to write a wiki page in addition to your role.

Even though this is a group assignment, each team member will be graded individually based on their contribution to the wiki (their page).
